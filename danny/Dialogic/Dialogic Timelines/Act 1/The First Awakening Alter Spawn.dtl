Narrator: "You wake to the scent of burning wax... the chill of cold stone beneath you with blood splatter. Shadows flicker on the cavern walls figures, chanting. A ritual? A sacrifice? You can’t remember... but you know one thing. You were not meant to leave this place."
Narrator: "Your arms and legs refuse to move—ropes bite into your skin. Panic sets in. But fear is a weak chain, easily broken. Struggle, and you might yet live."
