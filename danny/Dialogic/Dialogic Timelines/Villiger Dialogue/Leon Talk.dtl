Leon: "I had a son once... a bright boy. He used to run through these streets, laughing. Then one night, he vanished. No one would tell me why."
- “Do you think he’s still alive?”
	Leon: Leon looks away, her voice hollow.
	Leon: "No. I feel it in my bones. But the Elder... he never speaks of the missing. Only of duty and sacrifice."
	- “What do you mean, no one would tell you why?”
		Leon: Leon clenches her fists
		Leon: "They say it was fate. That he was ‘chosen.’ But who decides such things? And why do they never choose their own?"
		- “I will find the truth.”
			Leon: Leon looks at you, hope flickering in her weary eyes.
			Leon: "If you do... don’t trust everything they tell you. Especially not him."
