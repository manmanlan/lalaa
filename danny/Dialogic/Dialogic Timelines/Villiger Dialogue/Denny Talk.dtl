Denny: "My daughter loved flowers. Used to weave them into crowns and place them on my head, laughing. It’s been years since I heard that laugh."
- “What happened to her?”
	Denny: Denny exhales sharply, jaw tightening.
	Denny: "The Elder told me it was a tragedy. A mistake. But I never saw a body, never found a grave. Just... silence."
	- “You don’t believe him, do you?”
		Denny: Denny's teeth clench
		Denny: "Belief is a luxury I can’t afford. The Elder speaks of duty. But when duty costs a life, who really pays the price?"
		- “I want to help.”
			Denny: Denny finally meets your gaze, his eyes dark with sorrow.
			Denny: "Then be careful. The dungeon takes more than just lives. It takes truth... and buries it deep."
